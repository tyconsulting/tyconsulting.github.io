Azure Policy can feel overwhelming due to its complexity and the sheer volume of policies that need to be managed. Organizations often struggle with:

- **Lack of Visibility**: Difficulty in understanding which policies are in place and their impact on resources.
- **Lack of Reporting and Compliance Monitoring**: Challenges in tracking compliance status and generating reports for audits.
- **Incorrect policy configurations**: It is common to have inconsistent, overlapping or incorrect policy definitions that can lead to security vulnerabilities.
- **No Clear Documentation**: Policies are often poorly documented, making it hard for teams to understand their purpose and implementation.
- **Lack of Security Control Mapping**: Inconsistent and lack of clarity in mapping policies to specific security controls or frameworks, leading to gaps in compliance.

> **Without reporting and collaboration, managing Azure policies at scale is error-prone, time-consuming, and lacks clarity across teams.**
